## Introduction

This period opened with the unrest following the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Baltimore and in cities across the country. At the national and the local level, the 1968 "riots" were seen by many as a wake up call of the urgent need for more agressive action on Civil Rights. However, others used the unrest to pursue a reactionary agenda opposed to Civil Rights.

Major themes in this period include:

- The changing leadership and organization of the Civil Rights movement in Baltimore.
- The increasing prominence of gender and feminism within the movement and the intersection between the Civil Rights movement and social movements for disability rights, LGBTQ rights, and others.
- The shift by many prominent Civil Rights groups from a focus on segregation and discrimination to the need to address the legacy of those factors through community development.
- The failure of the city to address school segregation.

### People

By 1971, 46% of the 41,000 municipal jobs in Baltimore were held by African American, key leadership positions such as the first black school superintendent, Ronald N. Patterson from Seattle in July 1971. Later, Mayor Schaefer appointed the first black police commissioner in 1984. [@sartain_borders_2013, 171]

Traditional Civil Rights organizations such as the NAACP and local chapter of the Baltimore Urban League saw their influence diminish in this period.

- Enolia McMillan
- Parren Mitchell

## Changing leadership and organization

- Actually have a vehicle for enforcement (Civil Rights Commission)
- Institutionalized (access to power) MHACC, Maryland Human Rights Commission, working within rather than outside (Vanguard Justice Society)

Changing leadership and organizations
- e.g. Soul School, Mother Rescuers
- End of Black Panthers (Black Panther Marshall "Eddie" Conway arrested in Baltimore)

New leadership at NAACP

## Gender

The growth of the feminist movement at a national level brought new opportunities for African American women in Baltimore during this period and focused attention on sexism within the Civil Rights movement and racism within the feminist movement.

The late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes for national policies affecting women. On October 13, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375) forbidding sex discrimination in businesses working with the government. In 1972, Congress passed [Title IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX) of the [1972 Educational Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Amendments_of_1972) to the Civil Rights Act to enforce sex equality in education (forcing educational institutions to support women's sports).  On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down many state abortion laws with the [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) decision.

Activists also organized at the national level as in 1966 the National Organization for Women (NOW) organized in Washington, DC and, in 1973, the National Black Feminist Organization formed in New York.

>In the 1960s, PPM began providing education and training services in addition to direct health care. Clinics were opened in churches and universities; chapters were founded in other communities; education centers flourished in nearly every county in the state. Federal and state funding reached an all-time high in the 70s, only to be cut drastically in the next decade by President Ronald Reagan. PPM throughout this time maintained a strong history of growth and stability. - See more at: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-maryland/who-we-are/history-highlights#sthash.scGkXncW.dpuf -->

## Shift to community development issues

The shift of Baltimore's Civil Rights movement to focus on community development was an evolution, not a revolution, from the work of prior decades. After all, affordable housing and public health for African Americans had emerged and remained major concerns for local activists throughout the twentieth century. However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, activists now had new resources from the city and the federal government to pursue community goals. In addition, many hoped to learn from the failure of "urban renewal" programs in Harlem Park and other neighborhoods in the 1940s and 1950s and shift to an approach where community residents and community-based organizations took on more prominent leadership roles in the process.

Echoing later community development efforts activsts pursued both an "inside" and "outside" game. The "inside" game work in historically segregated black neighborhoods to do work including:

- Expanding access to culture, arts, and recreation (e.g. Operation CHAMP; Eubie Blake Cultural Center)
- Job training and business development
- Affordable housing development (especially in partnership with churches, e.g. St. James Terrace; N.M. Carroll Apartments)

The outside game focused on:

- Housing segregation and discrimination (especially in Baltimore County or historically segrgeated white neighborhoods)
- Hiring policies for white-owned businesses

These efforts are exemplified by nonprofit groups like the Druid Heights Community Development Corporation (established 1974) and Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) (founded 1977); and by new city and state agencies such as the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) (established 1969).

Ultimately, these efforts in Baltimore contributed to a national effort to change federal policy. For example, the [Equal Credit Opportunity Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act) was approved in 1974 to make it against the law for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant by race, gender. In 1977, the [Community Reinvestment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act) passed.

### Housing segregation and discrimination

In 1969, a coalition of black and white civil rights advocates, including chairman Sampson Green, an African-American attorney, member of the Maryland Human Relations Commission, and housing committee chairman, and John J. Martinez, white Jesuit teacher at St. Bernadine’s, organized The Activists—an interracial fair housing organization. The group targeted the Morris Goldseker Company with protests outside its downtown offices highlighting its role as “block-busters.” Operating under a variety of names, the Goldseker-related realty companies doubled the mark-up on house sales in Edmondson Village in comparison to other areas. The Activists described how companies purchased houses for an average of $7,320 and sold them for an average of $12,387, a markup of 69%, with the inescapable conclusion that, “The dollar in the hands of the white man buys more than the dollar in the hands of the black man.”[@orser_blockbusting_1994]

In August 1970, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission holds hearing on suburban development in Baltimore County.
